#  CSE Learning Roadmaps Platform

##  Problem Statement
Many engineering students struggle to find a **clear and structured learning path** in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). Due to the lack of proper guidance and scattered resources, students often feel confused about where to start and how to progress in their chosen field. Our research indicates that nearly **97% of students** face this issue at some point in their learning journey.
